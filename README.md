# bidd-sportv2

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key features in Bidd Sports v2:

Intuitive Workflow: The app is now organized into a clear hierarchy: Competitions -> Events -> Results.

Custom Competitions: You can create and edit competitions, each with its own custom list of Age Groups (e.g., U10, U12, Senior).

Flexible Events: When creating an event, you can assign it an Age Group from your custom list, a Category (e.g., Track, Field, Swimming) for better organization, and an Event Type (Time, Distance, or Points).

Gender-Specific Records & Results: The app tracks records and results separately for Male and Female participants. The results table is now tabbed for each gender.

Reliable CSV Import: The CSV import function has been simplified to a per-event basis to ensure it is robust and reliable. You can easily map your file's columns to the required fields.

Full Edit/Delete Capabilities: You can edit or delete competitions, events, and individual participants.

Comprehensive Reporting: The PDF export functions have been fixed and now include:

Full Results: A complete list of results for an event.

Qualifiers Report: A clean report of only the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers for both genders.

Team Points Summary: A report of the overall team standings.

Robust Offline Mode: The app's offline capabilities have been enhanced to ensure it works reliably on any device, even with a spotty internet connection.
